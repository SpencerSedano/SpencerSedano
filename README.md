## 📂 Featured Projects

- 🧠 **Hoverzi** – A Chrome Extension. Hover to translate Chinese to English - more features coming soon.
- 📸 **Memfie** – Built with React Native and C#. This app reminds you to take a daily photo to create a timelapse video.   
- 🖥️ **Widgit** – Built with React, React Native, C#, and C. The system uses a Waveshare ePaper display connected to a C-based embedded device (ESP32). I created a React dashboard with a C# backend where you can drag and drop widgets — the layout is then reflected in real time on the ePaper screen.
